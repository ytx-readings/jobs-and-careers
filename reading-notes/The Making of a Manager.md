## Introduction: Great Managers Are Made, Not Born

> * But most managers are not CEOs or senior executives. Most lead smaller teams, and sometimes not even directly. Most are not featured in the pages of Forbes or Fortune. But they are managers all the same, and they share a common purpose: **helping a group of people achieve a common goal**. These managers may be teachers or principals, captains or coaches, administrators or planners.
> * I believe this as deeply as I believe anything: **Great managers are made, not born.** It doesn't matter who you are. If you care enough to be reading this, then you care enough to be a great manager.

## Chapter 1: What is Management?

> * The job of a soccer player is to win games.
> * The management aspect has nothing to do with employment status and everything to do with the fact that _you are no longer trying to get something done by yourself_.
> * At the same time, you're giving up some level of control. You won't get to make every decision anymore.
> * This is the crux of management: It is the belief that a team of people can achieve more than a single person going it alone. It is the realization that you don't have to do everything yourself, be the best at everything yourself, or even know _how_ to do everything yourself.
> * **Your job, as a manager, is to _get better outcomes from a group of people working together_.**

How to tell a great manager from an average manager?

> * If the job is defined as getting better outcomes from a group of people working together, then a great manager's team will consistently achieve great outcomes.
> * If the outcome you care about is getting amazing design, then a great manager's team will consistently deliver concepts that wow. A mediocre manager's team will produce work that gets the job done but doesn't stand out. A bad manager's team will regularly suggest proposals that make you think, _Surely we can do better than this_.
> * One should look at "the _output_ of the work unit and not simply the _activity_ involved."
> * You can be the smartest, most well-liked, most hardworking manager in the world, but if your team has a long-standing reputation for mediocre outcomes, then unfortunately you can't objectively be considered a "great" manager.
> * That said, at any given point in time, it can be hard to accurately judge. A great manager might be asked to lead a new team, and because it takes her time to ramp up, her results might be unimpressive at the beginning. On the flip side, a bad manager might achieve a few quarters of amazing results because she inherited a talented team or set high-pressure ultimatums that had people burning the midnight oil.
> * Time, however, always reveals the truth. The best employees don't tend to stick around for years and years under a boss who treats them poorly or whom they don't respect. And talented managers can typically turn around poor-performing teams if they are empowered to make changes.
> * One of the earliest conversations I remember us having is when I asked him how he evaluates the job ofa manager. He smiled and said, "My framework is quite simple." Half of what he looked at was my team's results — did we **achieve our aspirations** in creating valuable, easy-to-use, and well-crafted design work? The other half was based on the **strength and satisfaction** of my team — did I **do a good job hiring and developing individuals**, and **was my team happy and working well together**?

* Criteria of a great manager:
    * _Present outcomes_: Achieving aspirations and goals
    * _Future potentials_: Hiring and developing individuals for great outcomes in the future

> * Through thick or thin, in spite of the hundreds of things calling for your attention every day, never forget what you're ultimately here to do: help your team achieve great outcomes.

Three things managers think about all day: **_purpose_, _people_, and _process_** — why, who, and how.

* **Purpose**: what the team tries to accomplish; ensure that _your team knows what success looks like and cares about achieving it_.
* **People**: who your team members are; have great people that are set up to succeed, have right skills, and are motivated to do great work.
* **Process**: how your team works together; care about how everyone is supposed to work, what are the team's values, and what principles should govern decision-making.

> * Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.
> * Once you're able to breathe, your stomach is full, and you're in a safe environment, then you can focus on the next levels up in the hierarchy, such as being part of a community that supports you or contributing something meaningful with your life — what Maslow called "self-actualization."

Managing in survival mode:

> * When you are in survival mode, you do what it takes to survive.
> * When you're beyond survival in your team's hierarchy of needs, then you can plan for the future and think about what you can do today that will help you achieve more in the months and years ahead.

How do I know if you will be a great manager?

* Ask yourself three questions:
    1. **Do I Find It More Motivating to Achieve a Particular Outcome or to Play a Specific Role?** You are judged on your team's outcomes, so you do whatever most helps them succeed.
    2. **Do I like talking with people?** You will have to spend a lot of time with others, and your major responsibility is to support the individuals to thrive.
    3. **Can I Provide Stability for an Emotionally Challenging Situation?** You need to remain steady and be able to provide care and support through the bumps and dips of life.
* Other common answers to the question: **Why do you want to be a manager?**
    * _I want to progress in my career_ — If you work in an organization supporting individual contributor, take the advantage that you have such choice if it better fits your strengths.
    * _I want freedom to call the shots_ — Managers have the responsibility to make decisions in the interest of the team.
    * _I was asked to be a manager_ — If this is not what you want to do, talk to your manager to help you explore alternative career paths.

Difference between leadership and management:

* **Manager** is a specific role to manage other people;
* **Leadership** is the skill of being able to guide and influence others.

> * Leadership is a quality rather than a job. We are all leaders and followers at different points in our lives. Many aspects of this book should be useful to those looking to grow as leaders as well as managers, and great managers should cultivate leadership not just in themselves but also within their teams.
> * This is an important distinction because while the role of a manager can be given to someone (or taken away), leadership is not something that can be bestowed. It must be earned. People must _want_ to follow you.
> * You can be someone's manager, but if that person does not trust or respect you, you will have limited ability to influence him. I did not suddenly become a "leader" the day my title officially changed. On the contrary, some of my reports were initially skeptical, and it took time for us to develop a strong relationship.
