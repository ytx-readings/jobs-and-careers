## Introduction: Great Managers Are Made, Not Born

> * But most managers are not CEOs or senior executives. Most lead smaller teams, and sometimes not even directly. Most are not featured in the pages of Forbes or Fortune. But they are managers all the same, and they share a common purpose: **helping a group of people achieve a common goal**. These managers may be teachers or principals, captains or coaches, administrators or planners.
> * I believe this as deeply as I believe anything: Great managers are made, not born. It doesn't matter who you are. If you care enough to be reading this, then you care enough to be a great manager.
