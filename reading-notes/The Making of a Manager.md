# [_The Making of a Manager_](../books/The%20Making%20of%20a%20Manager%20by%20Julie%20Zhuo.pdf)

## Introduction: Great Managers Are Made, Not Born

> * But most managers are not CEOs or senior executives. Most lead smaller teams, and sometimes not even directly. Most are not featured in the pages of Forbes or Fortune. But they are managers all the same, and they share a common purpose: **helping a group of people achieve a common goal**. These managers may be teachers or principals, captains or coaches, administrators or planners.
> * I believe this as deeply as I believe anything: **Great managers are made, not born.** It doesn't matter who you are. If you care enough to be reading this, then you care enough to be a great manager.

## Chapter 1: What is Management?

> * The job of a soccer player is to win games.
> * The management aspect has nothing to do with employment status and everything to do with the fact that _you are no longer trying to get something done by yourself_.
> * At the same time, you're giving up some level of control. You won't get to make every decision anymore.
> * This is the crux of management: It is the belief that a team of people can achieve more than a single person going it alone. It is the realization that you don't have to do everything yourself, be the best at everything yourself, or even know _how_ to do everything yourself.
> * **Your job, as a manager, is to _get better outcomes from a group of people working together_.**

### How to tell a great manager from an average manager?

> * If the job is defined as getting better outcomes from a group of people working together, then a great manager's team will consistently achieve great outcomes.
> * If the outcome you care about is getting amazing design, then a great manager's team will consistently deliver concepts that wow. A mediocre manager's team will produce work that gets the job done but doesn't stand out. A bad manager's team will regularly suggest proposals that make you think, _Surely we can do better than this_.
> * One should look at "the _output_ of the work unit and not simply the _activity_ involved."
> * You can be the smartest, most well-liked, most hardworking manager in the world, but if your team has a long-standing reputation for mediocre outcomes, then unfortunately you can't objectively be considered a "great" manager.
> * That said, at any given point in time, it can be hard to accurately judge. A great manager might be asked to lead a new team, and because it takes her time to ramp up, her results might be unimpressive at the beginning. On the flip side, a bad manager might achieve a few quarters of amazing results because she inherited a talented team or set high-pressure ultimatums that had people burning the midnight oil.
> * Time, however, always reveals the truth. The best employees don't tend to stick around for years and years under a boss who treats them poorly or whom they don't respect. And talented managers can typically turn around poor-performing teams if they are empowered to make changes.
> * One of the earliest conversations I remember us having is when I asked him how he evaluates the job ofa manager. He smiled and said, "My framework is quite simple." Half of what he looked at was my team's results — did we **achieve our aspirations** in creating valuable, easy-to-use, and well-crafted design work? The other half was based on the **strength and satisfaction** of my team — did I **do a good job hiring and developing individuals**, and **was my team happy and working well together**?

* Criteria of a great manager:
    * _Present outcomes_: Achieving aspirations and goals
    * _Future potentials_: Hiring and developing individuals for great outcomes in the future

> * Through thick or thin, in spite of the hundreds of things calling for your attention every day, never forget what you're ultimately here to do: help your team achieve great outcomes.

### The three things managers think about all day

The three things managers think about all day: **_purpose_, _people_, and _process_** — why, who, and how.

* **Purpose**: what the team tries to accomplish; ensure that _your team knows what success looks like and cares about achieving it_.
* **People**: who your team members are; have great people that are set up to succeed, have right skills, and are motivated to do great work.
* **Process**: how your team works together; care about how everyone is supposed to work, what are the team's values, and what principles should govern decision-making.

> * Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.
> * Once you're able to breathe, your stomach is full, and you're in a safe environment, then you can focus on the next levels up in the hierarchy, such as being part of a community that supports you or contributing something meaningful with your life — what Maslow called "self-actualization."

### Managing in survival mode

> * When you are in survival mode, you do what it takes to survive.
> * When you're beyond survival in your team's hierarchy of needs, then you can plan for the future and think about what you can do today that will help you achieve more in the months and years ahead.

### How do you know if you will be a great manager?

* Ask yourself three questions:
    1. **Do I Find It More Motivating to Achieve a Particular Outcome or to Play a Specific Role?** You are judged on your team's outcomes, so you do whatever most helps them succeed.
    2. **Do I like talking with people?** You will have to spend a lot of time with others, and your major responsibility is to support the individuals to thrive.
    3. **Can I Provide Stability for an Emotionally Challenging Situation?** You need to remain steady and be able to provide care and support through the bumps and dips of life.
* Other common answers to the question: **Why do you want to be a manager?**
    * _I want to progress in my career_ — If you work in an organization supporting individual contributor, take the advantage that you have such choice if it better fits your strengths.
    * _I want freedom to call the shots_ — Managers have the responsibility to make decisions in the interest of the team.
    * _I was asked to be a manager_ — If this is not what you want to do, talk to your manager to help you explore alternative career paths.

### Difference between leadership and management

* **Manager** is a specific role to manage other people;
* **Leadership** is the skill of being able to guide and influence others.

> * Leadership is a quality rather than a job. We are all leaders and followers at different points in our lives. Many aspects of this book should be useful to those looking to grow as leaders as well as managers, and great managers should cultivate leadership not just in themselves but also within their teams.
> * This is an important distinction because while the role of a manager can be given to someone (or taken away), leadership is not something that can be bestowed. It must be earned. People must _want_ to follow you.
> * You can be someone's manager, but if that person does not trust or respect you, you will have limited ability to influence him. I did not suddenly become a "leader" the day my title officially changed. On the contrary, some of my reports were initially skeptical, and it took time for us to develop a strong relationship.

## Chapter 2: Your First Three Months

Your path as a manager joining a new team:

* [Apprentice](#the-apprentice): managing a part of your manager's growing team
* [Pioneer](#the-pioneer): You are a founding member of a new group and responsible for its growth
* [New Boss](#the-new-boss): managing an already established team
* [Successor](#the-successor): taking over the management of the entire team from your previous manager

### The Apprentice

What to take advantage of:

* This is usually the easiest way to transition into being a manager.
* You have a sense of what works and what doesn't.
* You're able to ramp up quickly because you have context.

What to watch out for:

* It can feel awkward to establish a new dynamic with former peers. The challenges may include:
    * Playing the role of coach.
    * Having hard conversations.
    * Having people treat you differently or share less information with you.
* It's tricky to balance your individual contributor commitments with management.

### The Pioneer

What to take advantage of:

* You've done the job, so you know what it takes.
* You get to build the team that you want.

What to watch out for:

* You may not have much support.
* It's tricky to balance your IC work with management.

### The New Boss

What to take advantage of:

* People cut you slack in the beginning.
* You start with a blank slate.

What to watch out for:

* It takes a while to adjust to the norms of a new environment.
* You need to invest in building new relationships.
* You don't know the job and what it takes.

### The Successor

What to watch out for:

* It can feel awkward to establish a new dynamic with former peers.
* The increase in responsibility can feel overwhelming.
* You feel pressure to do things exactly like your former manager.

> * Your first three months as a new manager are a time of incredible transition. By the end of it, the day-to-day starts to feel familiar — you're adapting to new routines, you're investing in new relationships, and you may begin to have a sense of how you can best support your team.
> * But time isn't a substitute for comfort. That new-kid-at-school feeling may linger for months or years longer. New managers often ask me, "How long will it take to feel like I know what I'm doing?" I reply quite honestly, "It took me about three years."

## Chapter 3: Leading a Small Team

> * You don't build Rome in a day, and you don't start off your management career standing in front of a packed room delivering a ten-year vision. Instead, most of us begin by managing just a few people. You cultivate an environment of trust while diving into the detailed depths of the work. Everybody knows everybody, and two pizzas are enough to feed the group.
> * Managing a small team is about mastering a few basic fundamentals: developing a healthy manager–report relationship and creating an environment of support.

### Everything always goes back to people

> * **A manager's job is to _get better outcomes from a group of people working together_ through influencing purpose, people, and process.**

What gets in the way of good work:

1. People don't know how to do good work.
2. They know how, but they aren't motivated.

Why would someone not motivated to good work?

1. He doesn't have a picture of what great work looks like
2. The role doesn't align with his aspirations; he would like to do something else instead
3. Nothing would change if he puts into more effort – no rewards if things improve, and no penalties if they don't

Addressing concerns about lackluster work:

1. Diagnose the people issues behind it
2. Discuss with them whether it is an issue of motivation
3. If it doesn't work out, dive into the issue of skills

### Trust is the most important ingredient

> * It's human nature to want your manager to think well of you. Coming across as a complainer, a failure, or a problem employee seems like one of those obvious don'ts in managing up.
> * The issue, of course, is that if your reports don't tell you how they're really feeling, you can't help them. You may miss early warning signs that lead to bigger problems down the road. People's dissatisfaction will fester beneath the surface until one day they surprise you with their resignation. And most of the time when that happens, they're not just quitting your company, they are also quitting you.
> * You can avoid being blindsided by developing a relationship founded on trust, in which your reports feel that they can be completely honest with you because they have no doubt that you truly care about them.

Three statements that signify that you have accomplished trust:

1. My reports regularly bring their biggest challenges to my attention.
2. My report and I regularly give each other critical feedback and it isn't taken personally.
3. My reports would gladly work for me again.

### Strive to be human, not a boss

Important ways a manager to earn trust with their reports:

* **Respect and care about your report**
    * _managing is caring_: help your report be successful and fulfilled in her work; learn what they care about; understand that we are not separate people at work and at home
    * Unconditionally respect a person _as a whole_ rather than what they do for you
* **Invest time to help your report**
    * Make 1:1 useful for addressing problems that may not come up otherwise
        * 1:1 strategies:
            * Discuss top priorities
            * Calibrate what "great" looks like
            * Share feedback
            * Reflect on how things are going
    * A coach's best tool for understanding what's going is to _ask_
        * Questions to get the conversations moving:
            * **Identify**: understand what really matters for your report and what topics are worth spending more time on
                * What's top of mind for you right now?
                * What priorities are you thinking about this week?
                * What's the best use of our time today?
            * **Understand**: get to the root of the problem and what can be done about it
                * What does your ideal outcome look like?
                * What's hard for you in getting to that outcome?
                * What do you really care about?
                * What do you think is the best course of action?
                * What's the worst-case scenario you're worried about?
            * **Support**: zero in on how you can be of greatest service to help your report
                * How can I help you?
                * What can I do to make you more successful?
                * What was the most useful part of our conversation today?
* **Be honest and transparent about your report's performance**
    * Your report should have a clear sense at all times of what your expectations are and where he stands
    * Don't assume he can read between the lines or that no news is good news
* **Admit your own mistakes and growth areas**
    * _People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel._
    * When we are going through tough times, the thing that's often the most helpful isn't advice or answers but _empathy_.
    * Show your reports authentically your fears, mistakes and uncertainties will let you build a better relationship with reports.

### Help people play to their strengths

> * We humans are wired to see the bad more clearly than the good. It's an evolutionary advantage, after all. Imagine you are an ancient cave dweller surveying the landscape: Would you rather be better at noticing what's fine and normal — deer grazing, tree branches swaying, the sun shining — or at spotting the hungry lion in the shadows?
> * As a manager, my attention is similarly drawn toward the problem spots. I'm usually focused on the designs that aren't quite there, the projects that are slipping behind schedule, or the teams that have hiring needs. Whenever I'm talking with my reports, it's easy to spend all our time on the things that need improvement.
> * And yet, all of us likely remember moments when a kind word
about our unique strengths made us swell with pride and gave us more fuel to achieve our goals.

> * If you have five people on your team, four of whom are doing well and one who isn't, you may feel like you should focus most of your time and energy on the struggling report because you want to “fix” the problem. But in the same way that **individuals should play to their strengths**, so should you pay attention to your team's **top talent — the people who are doing well and could be doing even better**. Don't let the worst performers dominate your time — try to _diagnose, address, and resolve their issues_ as swiftly as you can.
> * Good CEOs know that they should double down on the projects that are working and put more people, resources, and attention on those rather than get every single project to the point of "not failing." Similarly, good investors know that helping to identify and grow a single start-up into the next billion-dollar company is worth dozens of other investments that lose money. The rising stars on your team may not be clamoring for your attention, but if you help them to dream bigger and become more capable leaders, you'll be amazed at how much more your team can do as a whole.

### The one thing you shouldn't tolerate on your team

* "**The No Asshole Rule**" — an _asshole_ is a person who makes other feel worse or who specifically targets people that are less powerful than him or her
    * The team actually becomes _better off_ when brilliant assholes leave
    * It is possible to find people who are just as talented and who are humble and kind
    * Assholes can change if you set up a culture that won't tolerate them

### You don't always have to make it work

* Personal and organization values have a huge impact on whether someone would be happy on a given team; if no, the person will find frequent misalignment between their team's jobs and what they want for their own career.
* If the fit isn't right, sometimes a move within the same organization solves the problem; if not, then person may not fit the company as a whole, and parting ways may be the best outcome for everyone.
* Do not try to fit a round peg into a square hole. Each of us ought to be working in an environment where we love with the people who share our passions.

### Make people moves quickly

* Mismatched values may make a person feel frustrated, for example if his innovated ideas and concepts are consistently rejected in favor of more practical ones.
* If a person has a fundamental skill gap affecting their ability to do the job well, it is unreasonable to expect that the best coaching could turn things around in a few months.
* Two options when you see someone isn't a good fit for your team: _help them find a new role in your organization_ or _let them go_.
    * The first option should always be considered. If a better role is more aligned with the person's interests and skills, it is the best outcome both for that person and for the company.
    * Do not hesitate to let a person go if they lack the right skills or demonstrate toxic behavior. This may be unfortunate, but you need to do it respectfully and directly.
* The relationship between a manager and a report is a two-way street.
* The right coaching can both help your report get on the best possible path towards the next chapter, and help you become a better manager.
* Letting people go is an extreme situation. More commonly, the right coaching can help your reports understand what to aspire to, how to overcome habits holding them back, and how to grow their impact.

## Chapter 4: The Art of Feedback

> * For a leader, giving feedback — both when things are going well and when they aren't — is one of the most fundamental aspects of the job. Mastering this skill means that you can knock down two of the biggest barriers preventing your reports from doing great work — unclear expectations and inadequate skills — so that they know exactly where to aim and how to hit the target.

### What does great feedback look like?

Why great feedback is meaningful to you: _inspire you to change your behavior, resulting in your life getting better_.

How to make great feedback:

1. **Set clear expectations at the beginning**: tell your report what great jobs looks like, and how it distinguishes from mediocre and bad jobs.
2. **Give task-specific feedback as frequently as you can**: address what is done well and what could be done better in the future; focus on _what_ rather than _who_.
3. **Share behavioral feedback thoughtfully and regularly**: behavioral feedback provides a level of personalization and depth that is missing on task feedback; helps people understand how others see thm, often different from how they see themselves.
4. **Collect 360-degree feedback for maximum objectivity**: gathering behavioral feedback from a handful of colleagues leads to better insights.

### Every major disappointment is a failure to set expectations

If a report gets a rude shock the next month on performance review, he may have three explanations, none of which are good:

> 1. The review isn't fair. If things really were so dire, why hasn't this come up until now? This must be a mistake.
> 2. The review is fair, but my manager was negligent and didn't realize I was underperforming until the end of the half.
> 3. The review is fair, but my manager wasn't honest in sharing feedback with me along the way, so I didn't have a chance to improve.

Examples of how _setting expectations early_ can preempt future disappointment:

1. Your report as made it clear that she wants a promotion
    * Tell them the gaps towards a promotion
    * Give them frequent feedback of how they are doing relative to the expectations
2. You've just assigned a challenging new project to your report
    * Let your report know how you are planning to get involved
    * Tell them which decisions you expect to make, and which they should make
3. Your team has set a goal to launch in October
    * You want to be informed sooner than later, so you have more options
    * Readjust expectations as quickly as possible, which helps people recover from errors with grace

### Your feedback only counts if it makes things better

_If your report doesn't see the problem, they have no way to fix it._ Consider the following factors when giving feedback:

* **Am I giving feedback often enough?** — Give feedback more often and remind yourself that you probably are not doing enough.
* **Is my feedback being heard?** — The best way is to make your report _feel safe_, and show that you are caring about them and want them to succeed.
* **Does my feedback lead to positive action?** — Remember these three tips to ensure that your feedback can be taken positively and acted upon by your report:
    1. Make your feedback as specific as possible.
    2. Clarify what success looks and feels like.
    3. Suggest next steps.

### Delivering critical feedback or bad news

> Telling your report something disappointing is both important and unavoidable. Here, the _how_ matters tremendously.

* When you deliver bad news to your report about your decision, you should speak it out at the first moment when you both sit down.
* Own the decision, and don't open it up for discussion.
* The best way to deliver bad news is to do it straightly, treat your report with respect, and signify that you are helping them improve.

> * Every relationship is different, so the frequency, style, and type of feedback that works for one person might not work for someone else. Mistakes are inevitable. But when you give feedback well and you help your report grow as a result, there is no better feeling.
> * No matter what happens, the skills your team members develop are theirs for life.

## Chapter 5: Managing Yourself

> * Being a great manager is a highly personal journey, and if you don't have a good handle on yourself, you won't have a good handle on how to best support your team.

### Everybody feels like an imposter sometimes

> * Imposter syndrome is what makes you feel as though you're the only one with nothing worthwhile to say when you walk into a room full of people you admire.

Why imposter syndromes hit managers so hard? Two reasons:

1. You are often looked to answers
2. You are constantly put in the position of doing things you haven't done before

> * Management isn't an innate skill. There is no such thing as an "all-around great manager" who can transition effortlessly between different leadership roles. We must look at the specific context.

### Get to brutal honesty with yourself

* Your strengths and weaknesses directly affect how you manage
* The world's top leaders come from vastly different molds
* How to _brutally_ and honestly understand yourself and how you lead:
    1. know your strengths — the things you are talented and love to do
    2. know your weaknesses and triggers
    3. calibration — make sure that how we perceive ourselves match reality
        * Ask others for their unvarnished opinions:
            * Ask your manager on what they think you are doing well and how they are expecting of you
            * Ask 3-7 people that work closely with you for feedback to help you improve
            * Ask for task-specific feedback to calibrate yourself on specific skills
* Understanding the difference between _fixed mindset_ and _growth mindset_; keep a growth mindset, and seek feedback from others to find out the _fastest path to get you where you want to go_

### Understand yourself at your best and worst

* Understand the habits that make yourself be your best
* Understand the situations that do the opposite — triggering an intensely negative reaction that derails your effectiveness
* Share your triggers and learn what other people's are

### Finding your confidence when you're in the pit

Tips to manage your mental state and escape from the pit:

1. **Don't beat yourself up for feeling bad**
    1. Recognize that everyone goes through hard times, and give yourself permission to worry
    2. Admit that you are feeling bad
2. **Repeat: "the story I have in my head is probably irrational"**
    1. Recognize how we are biased and how we perceive events in such way
        * When we gather a few data points, we try to construct the whole narrative without actually having all the facts
    2. When we encounter a negative story, step back and question whether your interpretation is correct
3. **Close your eyes and visualize**
    1. Use _brain imaging_ to visualize different scenarios
    2. Find out the mental state you'd like to be in, and make it work towards you
4. **Ask for help from people you can be real with**
    1. Admitting your struggles and asking for help is the opposite of weakness — it's a sign of courage and self-awareness
    2. Find your support group and use them as effective resources for assisting you to face challenges — difficult relationships, uncertainty about careers, balancing parenthood and work, etc.
5. **Celebrate the little wins**
    1. Focus on the ways you are winning
    2. Note down things you have done well and are proud of
6. **Practice self-care by establishing boundaries**
    1. Do not be overly stressed about work
    2. Set boundaries for other important aspects of your life, e.g. spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, exercising, giving back to your community, etc.

### Learning to be twice as good

How can you be twice as good:

* **Ask for feedback**: ask for feedback from other people _all the time_, hear it openly, and respond with real change, for your _self-improvement_
* **Treat your manager as a coach**: engage your manager for feedback; tell them hard problems _with your thinking_ so they can help you work through them
* **Set aside time to reflect and set goals**: do it everyday, for your own benefits, and find out what works best for you; set personal goals and do bigger look-backs every six months, to give yourself longer time to tackle ambitious projects and learn new skills
* **Take advantage of formal training**: While rarely urgent or necessary, formal training can be a great way to learn new skills and improve how you work and how you support the future of your team

> * Learning how to be a great leader means learning about your superpowers and flaws, learning how to navigate the obstacles in your head, and learning how to learn. With these tools comes the confidence that you're meant to be here just as you are — no masks or pretenses needed — and that you're ready for whatever challenges lie ahead.

## Chapter 6: Amazing Meetings

Good meetings are simple and straightforward, and you leave them with the same feeling every time:

* The meeting was a great use of my time.
I learned something new that will help me be more effective at my job.
* I left with a clearer sense of what I should do next.
* Everyone was engaged.
* I felt welcomed.

### What is a great outcome for your meeting?

In order to run great meetings, you should be clear about the meetings' objectives. Your ultimate purpose is to let members of the team feel closer and collaborate more effectively.

* Making a decision
    * A great decision-making meeting does the following:
        * Gets  decision made (obviously)
        * Includes the people *most directly affected by the decision as well as a clearly designated decision-maker
        * Presents all credible options objectively and with relevant background information, and includes the team's recommendation if there is one
        * Gives equal airtime to dissenting opinions and makes people feel that they were heard
    * Examples of bad outcomes to avoid:
        * People feel that their side wasn't presented well, so they don't trust the resulting decision.
        * Decisions take a long time to make, which delays progress. While important and hard-to-reverse decisions deserve deep consideration, be wary of spending too much time on small, easy-to-reverse decisions.
        * Decisions keep flip-flopping back and forth, which makes it hard to trust and act on them.
        * Too much time is spent trying to get a group to consensus rather than escalating quickly to a decision-maker.
        * Time is wasted on rehashing the same argument twenty different ways.
* Sharing information
    * A great informational meeting accomplishes the following:
        * Gets everyone on the same page about what success for the project looks like
        * Honestly represents the current status of the work, including an assessment of how things are going, any changes since the last check-in, and what the future plans are
        * Clearly frames open questions, key decisions, or known concerns to get the most helpful feedback
        * Ends with agreed-upon next steps (including when the next milestone or check-in will be)
* Generating ideas
    * A great generative meeting does the following:
        * Produces many diverse, non-obvious solutions through ensuring each participant has quiet alone time to think of ideas and write them down (either before or during the meeting)
        * Considers the totality of ideas from everyone, not just the loudest voices
        * Helps ideas evolve and build off each other through meaningful discussion
        * Ends with clear next steps for how to turn ideas into action
* Strengthening relationship
    * A great team-bonding meeting enables the following:
        * Creates better understanding and trust between participants
        * Encourages people to be open and authentic
        * Makes people feel cared for

### Invite the right people

* A great meeting is more likely to take place if everyone is necessary, and no one is extraneous
* To assess which people to invite, ask yourself: **Which people are necessary to make the outcome happen?**
* Solutions:
    * Shrink the attendee list.
    * Find other ways to invest in design education and building relationships, including providing detailed meeting notes and hosting more leadership Q&As.

### Give people a chance to come prepared

* "_The curse of knowledge_" — the cognitive bias that makes it difficult for people with certain knowledge to remember what it was like for a beginner seeing the information for the first time.
* Solution: help everyone come prepared
    * Sending out an agenda ahead of time
    * Follow-ups need to be treated with as much care as the preparation
    * In the last few minutes of a meeting, get into the habit of asking — make sure everyone attending the meeting agree on next steps
    * After the meeting, send out a recap to the attendees with a summary of the discussion, a list of specific action items and who is responsible for each, and when the next check-in will be
        * If a decision was made, then that should be communicated to the right people
        * If feedback was given, then that should be acted upon
        * If ideas were generated, then the meeting organizer should clarify what the process is to take those to the next stage

### Make it safe for people to contribute

> If you are a meeting organizer trying to generate ideas, make a decision, or create stronger relationships, you will get better results if you can get your entire group to contribute. This is why it's so important to foster a welcoming environment for questions, discussions, discourse, and dissent. If you present what you think is a brilliant idea but most of the room secretly thinks it's ridiculous, it doesn't help you if nobody feels comfortable telling you how they really feel.

Strategies to create a safe environment:

* Be explicit about the norms you want to set
* Change up your meeting format to favor participation
* Manage equal airtime
* Get feedback about your meeting

### Some meetings don't need you and some don't need to exist at all

> * As a manager, your time is precious and finite, so guard it like a dragon guards its treasure stash. If you trust that the right outcomes will happen without you, then you don't need to be there.
> * Be on the lookout as well for meetings that don't seem valuable for anyone. They should be canceled or revamped.
> * If you find yourself in a recurring meeting of questionable value, do everyone an important service by kindly letting the organizer know. Life's too short to be wasted in subpar meetings. Aim to make every single one you are a part of useful, awesome, and energizing so that your team can achieve more together.
